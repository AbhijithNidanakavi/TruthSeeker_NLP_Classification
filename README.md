# TruthSeeker

Model that leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to separate facts from fiction.  The dataset, ‘Corpus Proppy 1.0’, is a repository of rich textual content, housing an impressive array of 52,000 news articles meticulously sourced from over 100 different news/media outlets.

Powered by NLP wizadry, it classifies news articles either as propogandistic or non-propagandistic, so you can navigate the media maze with ease. 

Let the truth set you free !
